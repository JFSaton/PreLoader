# PreLoader

PreLoader is a script that leverage browser native caipabilites to create resource hints.
Current version of the API allows to load and cache asset types like: document, image, script, font.
As well as to use dns-prefech and preconnect link attributes.

## Setting up is easy!

In the WPL projects add the following to bower.json:
"pre-loader": "git@bitbucket.org:galacoraltelavivrd/preloader.git#{version}"
The loaded script will be downloaded in to the components directory.
add the pre-loader as a property in the require.conf.js under "path":
'pre-loader': '../components/pre-loader/dist/pre-loader'
now it's ready to be used:
var preLoader = require('pre-loader');
preLoader.document.preFetch('https://what.ever.com');

##General Data

preload: focuses on current navigation and fetches resources with high-priority. (can not be done on type document)

prefetch: is a low priority resource hint that allows the browser to fetch resources in the background
(idle time) that might be needed later.
When pre-fetching document the url supplied must be exactly as the url that will be used for the actual url
(Pre-fetching of only the domain will not give the wanted results)

dns-prefetch: Dns resolution is a process of converting a domain/hostname to an ip address required to access
a resource (this process is what converts a user friendly url like: http://qnimate.com to http://85.72.179.121 );
this requires a certain time and adds to the page loading process.

## Use Cases

When a user opens a menu and for example buttons in the menu are external links, running preLoader.document.preFetch on the
exact urls of the menu will help to cut down the redirection time when it actual happens.
